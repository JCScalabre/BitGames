# BitGames

## The Concept

Bit-Games is a website on which classmates, coworkers or a group of friends can play fun, smart games together. Whether they want to just kill some time and have some fun, or settle an issue through some friendly competition, Bit-Games is the site. Games will be simple, smart ‘brain games’, think Lumosity type games, that I’m hoping to make from scratch myself, probably using a framework called phaser.io. There will be a leaderboard page (see wireframe), on which scores will update live, as players complete games, done through React. Scores and data will be stored in a DB. There will be a login authentication option, so users can have their own profiles, on which info like high score, amount of times user played a certain game, etc will be displayed. If a user doesn’t login, they can still enter their name, and it will appear as “Name (Guest)” on the leaderboard, and not be stored permanently.
